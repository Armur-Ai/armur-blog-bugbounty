Asset discovery and documentation form the cornerstone of successful bug hunting. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the essential techniques and tools used by professional bug hunters to identify, map, and document target assets effectively. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced researcher, understanding these fundamentals will significantly improve your bug hunting success rate.

## Understanding Asset Discovery

Asset discovery is more than just finding subdomains. It's about creating a complete picture of your target's attack surface. This process involves identifying various digital assets, including:

### Domain Infrastructure

Modern organizations often operate numerous domains and subdomains. Understanding the relationship between these assets is crucial for comprehensive security testing. Start by identifying the main domains and expanding your search to include:

- Primary domains and their variations
- Subsidiary company domains
- Development and staging environments
- Cloud-based assets
- Legacy systems

## Tools for Asset Discovery

### Subdomain Enumeration Tools

- **Subfinder**: A powerful tool for passive subdomain discovery  
  *Command:* `subfinder -d example.com -o subdomains.txt`

- **Amass**: Comprehensive attack surface mapping  
  *Command:* `amass enum -d example.com -o amass_results.txt`

### Advanced Search Techniques

- **Google Dorks**  
  `site:example.com inurl:admin`  
  `site:example.com filetype:pdf`  
  `site:example.com`

- **Certificate Transparency Logs**  
  Using crt.sh for historical domain data  
  Analyzing SSL/TLS certificates for additional subdomains

## Documentation Best Practices

### Organizing Your Findings

Create a structured documentation system that includes:

- **Target Information:**  
  - Scope details
  - Contact information
  - Security policies
  - Rules of engagement

- **Asset Categories:**  
  - Live domains and subdomains
  - IP ranges
  - Cloud assets
  - Third-party services
  - Technology stack information

### Vulnerability Documentation Template:

- **Title:** Clear, descriptive vulnerability name
- **Severity:** CVSS score and rating
- **Description:** Detailed explanation of the issue
- **Steps to Reproduce:** Clear, numbered steps
- **Impact:** Business and technical impact
- **Remediation:** Suggested fixes
- **Screenshots/Videos:** Visual evidence
- **Additional Notes:** Related information or context

### Tools for Documentation

- **Note-Taking Platforms:**  
  - Notion: Collaborative documentation  
  - GitBook: Technical documentation  
  - Obsidian: Local markdown-based notes

- **Asset Management Tools:**  
  - Burp Suite Enterprise: Asset inventory  
  - Nuclei: Automated scanning and documentation  
  - XMind: Mind mapping for asset relationships

## Advanced Asset Discovery Techniques

- **GitHub Reconnaissance**  
  - Search for organization repositories
  - Analyze commit history
  - Review code for exposed assets
  - Monitor organization members' activities

- **Cloud Asset Discovery**  
  - AWS: aws-recon tool  
  - Azure: Azure-cli  
  - GCP: Cloud Asset Inventory

- **Historical Data Analysis**  
  - Wayback Machine analysis
  - DNS history review
  - Domain registration patterns

## Real-World Implementation

### Case Study: E-commerce Platform Asset Discovery

- **Initial Reconnaissance:**  
  - Primary domain identification
  - Technology stack analysis
  - Third-party service mapping

- **Extended Discovery:**  
  - Cloud infrastructure mapping
  - Development environment identification
  - API endpoint documentation

- **Documentation Process:**  
  - Asset categorization
  - Risk assessment
  - Attack surface documentation

## Best Practices for Ongoing Asset Discovery

- **Continuous Monitoring**  
  - Set up automated asset discovery tools
  - Implement change detection systems
  - Regular validation of existing assets

- **Collaboration and Reporting**  
  - Share findings with team members
  - Maintain updated documentation
  - Regular status reports

- **Quality Assurance**  
  - Verify discovered assets
  - Validate documentation accuracy
  - Regular review and updates

## Conclusion

Effective asset discovery and documentation are crucial skills for successful bug hunting. By following these methodologies and maintaining detailed documentation, you'll build a solid foundation for your security research. Remember to regularly update your knowledge of new tools and techniques, and always maintain organized, comprehensive documentation of your findings.
